GoNetworking
============

Example code demonstrating how the use of Go's standard networking libraries for plaintext and encrypted communications, drawn from conference talks in 2014.

Each of the examples is a self-contained program which can be launched with:

go run <xx>.go

The early HTTP examples assume that you'll use a browser to connect to the served pages. I may at a later date add example HTTP client applications.
